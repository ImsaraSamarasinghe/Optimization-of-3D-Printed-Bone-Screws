# Optimisation of Bone Screws using Topology Optimisation
This repository presents the code base developed during my master's project at Imperial College London to develop topologicaly optimsed bone screws. 
The code developed here has its backbone in the python finite element solver FIREDRAKE for solving the forward problem and 
the python interface of IPOPT, CYIPOPT, to solve a given optimisation problem.
